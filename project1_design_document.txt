+ In threads.h, added:
int64_t wakeup_tick;                /* Tick till wake up */
int64_t get_min_sleep_tick(void);   /* The minimum sleep ticks */
void thread_sleep (int64_t);        /* Move the current thread to the sleep queue. */
void thread_wakeup(int64_t);        /* Find a sleeping thread and move it to ready queue */

+ In threads.c, added:
static struct list sleep_list;              /* List of processes in THREAD_SLEEP state (processes are sleeping). */
static int64_t min_sleep_ticks;             /* The minimum sleep ticks */
static void reset_min_sleep_tick(void);     /* Reset the minimum sleep ticks to infinity */
#define min(x, y) (((x) < (y))? (x) : (y))  /* Find min between 2 variables. */
#define minimize(x, y) x = min(x, y)        /* Find the min between 2 variables and then assign to the first variable. */


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

In timer_sleep(ticks):
    1. First, record the current timer tick count (start).
    2. Assert that interrupts are enabled, ensuring that the system can respond to timer interrupts
    3. If the elapsed time since the start of the timer is less than the specified number of ticks, it proceeds with actual sleep, delegating the task to thread_sleep(start + ticks).

In thread_sleep(ticks):
    1. First, we disable the interrupt
    2. If the current thread is not idle, move it to the sleep list for actual sleeping
    3. Assign the tick to wakeup the thread
    4. Update the global minimum sleep ticks
    5. Mark the thread as BLOCKED and yield the CPU

When timer_interrupt() handler is invoked: 
    1. At each timer tick, it increments the global tick count (ticks).
    2. If the global minimum sleep tick is less than the current tick, some threads need to be waken up
    3. Invokes thread_wakeup(ticks) to move them to the ready list.

In thread_wakeup(ticks):
    1. Disable interrupts
    2. Iterate through the sleep list to find sleeping thread with wakeup_tick <= ticks (the one that should be waken up now since the timer has expired)
    3. Remove them from the sleep list, and unblock them.
    4. Updates the global tick with respect to those still sleeping


>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?
+ Using linked list sleep_list, selectively wakes up threads only when necessary, and efficiently tracks the next earliest wakeup time using get_min_sleep_tick(). 
+ Interrupts are briefly disabled during critical sections to ensure thread safety and prevent race conditions.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?
+ Interrupts are temporarily disabled during critical sections to prevent preemption and ensure that the current thread can complete its operation without interference.
+ Access to shared data such as sleep queue (sleep_list) is synchronized to prevent multiple threads from concurrently modifying them.

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?
+ During the execution of critical sections in timer_sleep(), interrupts are disabled to prevent timer_interrupt() from being invoked and potentially interfering with the synchronization process.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?
+ By utilizing linked list (sleep_list) and selectively waking up threads only when necessary, the system avoids busy waiting and optimizes resource utilization.
+ Synchronization such as locks and disabling interrupts during critical sections ensures thread safety and prevents race conditions ==> multiple threads to safely call timer_sleep() simultaneously without risking data corruption or inconsistent behavior.




             PRIORITY SCHEDULING
             ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

+ In threads.h, added:
struct lock *wait_on_lock;                      /* The lock that the thread is waiting on */
struct list donations;                          /* The threads to donate the priority to */
struct list_elem d_elem;                        /* List element on donation list */

void reset_priority(void);                      /* Reset the priority */
void thread_yield_if_not_max(void);             /* Preempt the thread if there is a higher priority thread */
struct thread* thread_highest_priority(void);   /* Get the thread with highest priority */
/* Returns true if the priority of the thread A > B. */
bool thread_cmp_priority(const struct list_elem*, const struct list_elem*, void*);
  

+ In synch.h, added:
/* Returns true if the priority of the thread in semaphore A is greater than that of semaphore B. */
bool sync_cmp_priority(const struct list_elem*, const struct list_elem*, void*);

>>>>> TODO

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?
+ When a thread attempts to acquire a lock, semaphore, or condition variable, it is inserted into the appropriate wait queue (donations list for locks or waiters list for semaphores and condition variables) based on its priority, ensuring that the highest priority thread is positioned at the front of the queue, the first to be waked up.
+ If priority donation occurs, where a lower-priority thread holding a lock donates its priority to a higher-priority thread waiting on that lock, the priority of the waiting thread is dynamically updated to reflect the donated priority. 


>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?
+ When a thread attempts to acquire a lock, it checks if the lock is available. If the lock is held by another thread, priority donation may occur.
+ The waiting thread inherits the priority of the holder of the lock, allowing it to proceed immediately if its new priority is higher than that of any other waiting threads.
+ Nested priority donation: where a thread holding a lock is itself waiting on another lock, the donation process continues recursively. Each waiting thread inherits the priority of the holder of the lock it is waiting on, ensuring that the highest effective priority is maintained throughout the chain of dependencies.
+ Once priority donation is completed, the waiting thread acquires the lock and proceeds with its execution. 
+ If the lock is not immediately available, the thread is blocked and added to the lock's wait queue until the lock becomes available.


>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.
+ Release the lock.
+ The holder's priority need to be updated if it received priority donations. 
+ If the released lock was responsible for donating priority to the holder, the holder's priority is restored to its original priority level before the donation occurred.
+ If a higher-priority thread is waiting on the released lock, it is unblocked and moved to the ready queue. 


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?
+ A potential race condition in thread_set_priority(): multiple threads attempt to change the priority of a target thread simultaneously. If thread A sets the priority of thread B while thread B is concurrently being scheduled to execute on another processor core, inconsistencies in the priority level of thread B may occur, leading to unexpected behavior.
+ To avoid this race condition, a lock to provide mutual exclusion during the priority setting process. When thread_set_priority() is invoked, it acquires the lock, ensuring that only one thread can modify the priority of a target thread at a time. 

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?
+ In comparison to alternative designs, these features enhance to manage thread priorities, prevent priority-related issues,promptly releasing the lock and unblocking the highest priority waiting thread ==> efficient resource utilization and prevents priority inversion scenarios.
+ By utilizing locks and synchronization mechanisms, we could keep thread safety and prevents race conditions in critical operations such as priority donation and modification.
